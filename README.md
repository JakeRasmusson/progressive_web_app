# Progressive Web App

## Description
  
My goal for this project was to create a progressive web app that could be installed on your local computer.  I also wanted to use the built in database in the brower to store any changes made.


## Installation

[Deployed Site](https://progressive-web-app-iw31.onrender.com/)

You can run the app locally by downloading the Github Repo, run 'npm run install', once done run 'npm run start' to build and start the server.  Or you can use the link above to use the hosted render site to interact with the site
  
## Usage

Now you can type and your changes will be saved.
